# Inception this you fucking casual

### I think they meant to say conception instead of Inception, cause I created close to 15 virtual machines during this project and only one survived, they are my child, I do not love them, hopefully someone else will

### Virtual machine are confusing, but at least unlike a Docker image they flash red when you destroy everything.
### You have to ask a Docker nicely and they will tell you absolutely nothing, but at least they contained the problem right?
